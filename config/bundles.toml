# config/bundles.toml

# Defines the available extension bundles for the Qi application.
# Each bundle specifies a list of extensions to load (`allow_list`) and
# environment variables (`env`) to set for that configuration.

# Default bundle for development.
# An empty allow_list means all discovered extensions will be loaded.
